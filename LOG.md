# PROGRESS LOG

As the course repo states, this is a retired course, so stumbling blocks and technical issues are to be expected.

### Lesson: [About Your Instructor](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/#about-your-instructor)

- Opened issue because could not find the progress snapshots. _Hopefully will be able to create them with this repo._
  - Issue [#37](https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/learneleventyfromscratch.com/issues/37)

### [Lesson One](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/lesson/1.html#what-is-eleventy)

- My code for lesson one: [repo branch "lesson-01"](https://github.com/maiya-22/learning-repo__learn-11ty-from-scratch/tree/Lesson-01)
- This repo is the "eleventy-from-scratch" repo the instructions tell you to create.
