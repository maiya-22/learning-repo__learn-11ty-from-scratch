## Learning 11ty From Scratch

- The goal of this repo is to go through [Andy Bell's](https://andy-bell.co.uk/links/) open source project [Learn 11ty from Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/) and add my learning process (ie errors and their solutions, and hopefully any help that I can get along the way) to the tutorial's [open source repo](https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/learneleventyfromscratch.com).
- I haven't found any tutorials that are up to date, so hopefully this process will help other learners too.

## Learning Log

- Repo Status: End of Lesson 4
- For Q & A, errors, and questions see the [LOG.md](https://github.com/maiya-22/learning-repo__learn-11ty-from-scratch/blob/main/LOG.md) file
  - Links to the solution code for each lesson are in the LOG.md file (link above).
- & look at the [issues](https://github.com/maiya-22/learning-repo__learn-11ty-from-scratch/issues)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the tutorial and document stumbling blocks (and their solutions).
2. The finished project from the tutorial will be used as a starting point for completing an 11ty boilerplate for web projects. (Repo to be linked here).
